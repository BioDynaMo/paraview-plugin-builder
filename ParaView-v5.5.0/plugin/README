===How to build your plugin===
 * Make sure the docker image have been created (docker images should show a paraview:5.5.0 image)
 * Create an archive named plugin.tgz containing a CMakeLists.txt at first level
 * Copy it in the directory
 * Create an associated plugin.cmake to configure your plugin if needed
 * ./run_build_plugin.sh
 * wait for completion
 * this repository now contains a lib*.so file compatible with ParaView 5.5.0 Release for Linux (ParaView-5.5.0-Qt5-OpenGL2-MPI-Linux-64bit.tar.gz)
