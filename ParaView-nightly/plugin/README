===How to build your plugin===
 * Make sure the docker image have been created (docker images should show a paraview:nightly_hash image)
 * Create an archive named plugin.tgz containing a CMakeLists.txt at first level
 * Copy it in the directory
 * Create an associated plugin.cmake to configure your plugin if needed
 * ./run_build_plugin.sh nightly_hash
 * eg: ./run_build_plugin.sh 8f65d9a
 * wait for completion
 * this repository now contains a lib*.so file compatible with a particular nigthly release of ParaView for Linux
